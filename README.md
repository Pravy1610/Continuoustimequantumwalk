# Continuoustimequantumwalk
Quantum walk is an extremely effective method for designing algorithms and for simulating complex quantum systems. Quantum walks are a quantum variant
of classical random walk, which based on whether the coin lands on heads or tails, goes left or right. Evolution of an isolated quantum system is deterministic, but
measurement is probabilistic, and when system is measured and classical information is available does randomness appear.   
Quantum walks can be implemented experimentally in a wide range of quantum setups. Space is discrete in quantum walk, while time might be discrete or continuous.
In continuous-time quantum walks, the shifting probability is controlled via a transition rate. The continuous time random walk takes place entirely in the position space
HP without any need for coin space. In the continuous-time scenario, the jumping probability is controlled by a transition rate γ. Transitions between nearest neighbours happen with γ probability per unit time.     
The CTQW’s probability distribution, like the DTQW’s, has two big exterior peaks and probability is low near the origin.In CTQW, γ controls the dispersion. When γ is reduced, distribution shrinks around origin, but pattern remains same.The evolution operator in CTQW acts continually in time, and measurements of the system state can be taken at any moment.
